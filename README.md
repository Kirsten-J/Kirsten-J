<br>Hey, I'm Kirsten. 
<br>
<br>👍 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data management for business decisions and process improvement. I hope to work in Business Analytics in the near future.
<br>🔭 I’m currently studying a Master's in Business Analytics, developing knowledge in data science in both R and Python, machine learning algorithms and improving my data visualization skills. I will also learn some SQL and Natural Learning Processing models in the following semester. I would love to collaborate and further improve my skills in these topics.
